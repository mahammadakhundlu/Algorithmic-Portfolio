# Algorithmic Problem-Solving Portfolio

### Introduction

This repository is a curated showcase of my solutions to complex algorithmic problems from platforms like CSES.

As a competitive programmer, I created this portfolio to provide concrete examples of my problem-solving abilities. Each solution demonstrates a practical application of key data structures, core algorithms, and efficient C++ programming.

### How This Repo is Organized

Each problem is contained within its own directory, as shown in the table below. Inside each directory, you will find:

* **`solution.cpp`**: The final, accepted source code.
* **`README.md`**: A detailed write-up explaining my thought process, the chosen algorithm, and an analysis of its time and space complexity.
